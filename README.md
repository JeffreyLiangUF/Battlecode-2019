# Battlecode 2019

## What is [Battlecode](http://www.battlecode.org/)?

Summary form the Battlecode Website:
"Battlecode is a real-time strategy game, for which you will write an AI player. In Battlecode, two teams of virtual robots roam the screen managing resources and executing different offensive strategies against each other. Your AI player will need to strategically manage your robot army and control how your robots work together to defeat the enemy team. As a contestant, you will learn to use artificial intelligence, pathfinding, distributed algorithms, and network communications to make your player as competitive as possible. "

Another great explanation and deeper dive into the 2019 Battlecode comes from a [post-mortem](http://jerrymao.net/blog/battlecode/) written by another finalist team NP-cgw. Highly recommend giving it a read if interested in Battlecode as it covers the "essence" of the competition.
